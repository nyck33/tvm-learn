# From tvm tutorials


### Usage
- download the tvm nightly build wheel with cuda support from here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NNxhwMz9Qo8mfhiu2CEHI_XU5UNmMPuP/view?usp=sharing
- build conda env with provided environment yaml file

### Note
I did the above because I had problems building from source with Cuda support and the Docker images were not working for me either.  

### my system
Windows 11, WSL2 Ubuntu 22.04
